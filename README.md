# ACH Debits

## Description
This is an automation bot that was programmed to complete ACH debit related tasks. ACH debits are transactions where external companies pull funds from the CHS bank account rather than having CHS send the
funds, and I need to manually clear these in SAP on a daily basis. This bot now handles most of this for me, which saves me 20 to 30 minutes on a daily basis. The bot acts as a user, i.e. it is capable 
of sending inputs and interacting with UI elements on the local machine that it is working on.

## Usage
This bot is still currently being built. Assuming that you have my same exact job and software stack on your local machine (otherwise this bot will not work as intended), simply pull the code, open it 
in UI Path Studio, and click 'run' in the top left corner of the window.
